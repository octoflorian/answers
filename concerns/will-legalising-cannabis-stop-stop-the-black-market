This is hard to say. Some people claim that restricting things like daily usage or the strength of cannabis will enable a black market to continue. In other countries, legalising cannabis has led to a drop-off in the black market, but this process has taken time. According to researchers, this could be because people take time to adjust to the legalisation of cannabis and the fact that in other nations (like Uruguay) the cost of cannabis is still lower on the black market than in the regulated market. However, we wonâ€™t really know what happens until we actual create a legal market for cannabis.
