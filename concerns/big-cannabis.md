That’s a big challenge. Large companies within the pharmaceutical industry, oil and gas, tobacco and other industries do hold lows of power internationally. They can often present economic benefits, and ignore or deny research around the harms their industries make.

One of the suggestions in the bill is to restrict the amount of the “market share” a business could have (preventing it from having too much power). This wouldn’t stop companies if they banded together, but it would prevent them from merging together into one large business. The bill also sets out that micro-companies (smaller licensed businesses) would have to hold a certain proportion of the market share.

There would be restrictions of advertising to groups and where stores could be set up to try and prevent targeting of specific communities. However, it would be important to continually update and monitor this and ensure that legalisation doesn’t add harm to already marginalised communities.
