In countries and states where cannabis is legal, the evidence on this is mixed. In Uruguay, there is some evidence to say there has been an increase in usage, but the style of legalisation there would be very different to the style of legalisation in New Zealand. However, it is really too soon to say what the impacts of legalising cannabis has been for other countries.

We should remember that occassional cannabis use is very common in New Zealand already, where it is currently illegal.
