Cannabis can have negative impacts on productivity, focus and attention. So cannabis can definitely have negative impacts on workplaces. Currently, lots of workplaces already have policies on drugs and alcohol. Some even have compulsory drug testing to ensure that people are not under the influence. So many organisations already have a stance against cannabis use while working.

If the bill were to pass, more people may show up to work high, conclusive evidence from other countries isn’t available. However, workplaces would still be able to have zero tolerance policies to drugs and alcohol, in the same way that people are expected to not show up drunk to work. There may be an increase in people ‘testing the limits’, but people could still face consequences for showing up to work high.
