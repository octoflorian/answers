title: Won’t this lead to every other drug being legalised?

It could, but no other country in the world has legalised all drugs, even if they have legalised cannabis or a different drug. Portugal has decriminalised drugs so that people don’t get criminal penalties (like jail time) but still can receive things like fines. 

So, from the global context there isn’t really any suggestion this would be the case, and the Government hasn’t stated any interest in legalising other drugs.
