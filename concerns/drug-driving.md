Drug driving in New Zealand is a serious issue, like many other countries in the world. 2/3 of cannabis users report drug driving in the past year, and around 1/5 of New Zealand drivers. However, legalising cannabis doesn’t necessarily change the Government’s stance on drug driving.

Currently, NZ has a zero-tolerance approach to driving while under the influence of cannabis. If the Bill passes, the Government will likely decide what ‘level’ of cannabis influence is okay. This could stay at zero, meaning that the Government will still have the same stance that driving under the influence of cannabis is not okay. If it were to change, it could be similar to alcohol, where we have a .05% blood alcohol content limit. This limit is monitored by police checks, and people can still be charged if they are over the limit.

Legalisation could lead to more people driving under the influence of cannabis. But like many other issues, it is complicated, and it would be up to the Government to decide what response they want to take on drug driving if the bill was passed.
