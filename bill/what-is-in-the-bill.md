The **Cannabis Legalisation and Control Bill** sets out a way for the Government to control and regulate cannabis. It makes rules the production, supply, and consumption of cannabis.

According to the Government, the Bill intends to reduce the harm that is currently being created by leaving cannabis consumption unregulated in New Zealand.

The Bill:

* stops the illegal supply of cannabis
* provides a legal way for adults to access cannabis that meets strict quality and potency requirements
* creates a new tax on cannabis products created for sale
* sets up a system where people that want to sell cannabis products must be licensed
* regulates where cannabis can be sold and how it can be marketed

The Bill doesn't cover medicinal cannabis because that's already legal under the Medicinal Cannabis Scheme.
